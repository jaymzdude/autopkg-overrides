# autopkg-overrides
A collection of AutoPKG overrides

This is a collection of overrides for AutoPKG that (at least initially) will be used to create .pkg files that are named specifically for my JAMF Pro environment. Because it is a non-centralized environment, we have a naming convention in place that specifies that any package created that will benefit all departments is prefaced with "All-". Additionally, I also want to have .pkg files named in a more generic format so that I can upload the packages directly to the distribution point and have them replace existing packages without resetting/recreating policies every time I send the up to the JSS. While I realize this is not standard, best practice, my intent is to use the packages that are created with version numbers in the titles as testing packages, and the more generically-named packages once the test packages have been verified. 

At least, that's the plan.
